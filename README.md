# bruinplanner
An interactive app/website for UCLA students that are in the college of engineering, to help design a 4 year plan based on the available and necessary classes. For too long, the HSEAS website has been horrible at presenting information clearly, with out of date major requirements, old “prospective” 4 year planners, and files all over the place. Instead, if students had an interactive 4 year planner, where they could select their major and visually see what the required classes and their respective pre reqs were, this would save a lot of unnecessary time and pain. Our website allows students to create an account that would give them access to a 4 year planner based on major in which they could organize their classes based on requirements.
